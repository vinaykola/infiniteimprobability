Title: About

Hi, I'm Vinay Kola. I like to code and have spent the last few years studying machine learning. I work at Snapchat now, dabbling in iOS, Android and server-side code too. You can look at some of my personal projects on [Github](http://github.com/vinaykola).

I'm a huge Manchester United fan, and you can find me talking about football (or soccer, for you Americans) and programming on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/vinaykola).
