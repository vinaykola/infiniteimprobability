Title: Bourne Again

Hey guys.

For what seems like the billionth time, I'm rebooting my blog to use a static site generator again. The last incarnation of my blog was using Ghost with DigitalOcean hosting, but I've decided that porting my blog to Google's AppEngine and using the free tier instead would save me some money.

I'm back to using Pelican again, this time with a new theme called svbhack.

I haven't decided what I want to blog about yet, but stay tuned.
