Hi guys.

Once again, I've decided to procrastinate by rebooting my blog, this time using DigitalOcean. I'm still using Pelican, a static site generator written in Python. 

My last few attempts at blogging have been catastrophic failures, so let's hope this reboot is more successful than Sony's continous attempts to reboot Spiderman.
